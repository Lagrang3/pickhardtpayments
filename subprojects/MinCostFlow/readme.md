Min Cost Flow library
=====================

This is a proof of concept library for solving the Min Cost Flow (MCF) problem
for linear and convex costs functions.
The code and API are highly specialized for the problem domain that involves the
*Uncertainty Networks*, a concept invented by Rene Pickhardt
and implemented in
[pickhardtpayments](github.com/renepickhardt/pickhardtpayments).

The algorithms used here are taken from Ahuja, et. al book "Network Flows:
Theory, Algorithms and Applications", 1993.

The C-API is described [here](c-api.md).
